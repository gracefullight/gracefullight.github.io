The data reveals that work-life balance and reduced commuting time were the most cited reasons.</p>\n<p>Work-life balance accounted for 30% of the responses, making it the leading factor. This was followed closely by the desire to avoid commuting, which represented 25%. Increased productivity was the third most common reason, at 20%, while health and safety concerns contributes to 15% of responses. Finally, flexible working hours were cited by 10% of participants.</p>\n<p>The data shows a clear trend toward personal convenience and well-being. The top of three reasons-balance, commute, and productivity-collectively represent 75% of the motivations, indicating a preference for conditions that enhance individual efficiency and lifestyle. Health-related concerns, while significant during global health crises, appear less dominant in 2024, suggesting a shift in focus from safety to sustained comfort and autonomy.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the chart underscores the growing importance of quality of life and flexibility in shaping modern work preferences.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"task2\">Task2<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-006/#task2\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Task2에 대한 직접 링크\" title=\"Task2에 대한 직접 링크\">​</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some people think it is more important to focus on the present, while others believe planning for the future is essential\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is an ongoing debate over whether people should prioritize living in the moment or concentrate on future planning. While present-focused individuals argue for making the most of today, others maintain that long-term thinking is vital for success. I believe both perspectives have merit and should be balanced.</p>\n<p>Advocates of living in the present argue that focusing on the now enhances happiness and reduces anxiety. They contend that excessive worry about the future can lead to missed opportunities and mental stress. Mindfulness practices, which encourage awareness of the present moment, have been shown to improve emotional well-being and foster gratitude.</p>\n<p>In contrast, those who support planning ahead believe that setting goals and preparing for possible challenges ensures greater stability. Financial planning, career development, and health maintenance all require foresight. Without long-term thinking, people may struggle tot achieve lasting success or face avoidable setbacks.</p>\n<p>In my view, the most effective approach integrates both attitudes. While it is essential to enjoy and engage with daily life, planning for the future provides direction and security. For example, saving money for retirement does not prevent someone from enjoying today's experiences, but rather ensures peace of mind in the long run.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, while it is beneficial to embrace the present, neglecting future planning can lead to adverse consequences. A balanced mindset that values both present enjoyment and future preparedness is key to a fulfilling life.</p>",

It is evident that hydro power leads significantly, whereas geothermal contributes the least.</p>\n<p>Hydro energy accounts for the largest capacity at 80 GW. Wind follows with 60 GW, and solar stands at 45 Gw. Biomass has a modest capacity of 20 GW, while geothermal sits at 10 GW, the smallest share. Overall, hydro capacity is four times that of geothermal and double that of wind, indicating a heavy reliance on water-based power generation.</p>\n<p>The disparity among success suggests strategic priorities and resource availability. Country Z's abundant river systems likely facilitate extensive hydro installations. Meanwhile, moderate wind and solar capacities reflect ongoing investments, and lower biomass and geothermal figures may be due to technological or geographical constraints. In summary, although Country Z is diversifying its renewable portfolio, the energy mix remains dominated by hydropower.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"task2\">Task2<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-005/#task2\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Task2에 대한 직접 링크\" title=\"Task2에 대한 직접 링크\">​</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some people believe that governments should prioritize investing in public parks and green spaces to enhance urban living, while others argue that funds should be allocated to infrastructure such as roads and public transport.\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Urban planners often debate the allocation of municipal funds between green spaces and infrastructure development. Advocates of public parks emphasize health and environmental benefits, whereas proponents of roads and transit prioritize economic growth and mobility. I maintain that a balanced approach best serves urban populations.</p>\n<p>Supporters of green spaces argue that parks improve air quality, reduce urban heat islands, and provide recreational areas crucial for physical and mental well-being. Studies show access to green spaces correlates with lower stress levels and enhanced community cohesion. Additionally, urban greenery can support biodiversity and stormwater management.</p>\n<p>Conversely, those favouring infrastructure investments contend that efficient roads and public transport systems drive economic activity, reduce congestion, and enhance accessibility. Well-maintained transport networks facilitate commerce and connect residential areas with employment hubs. In rapidly growing cities, inadequate infrastructure can stifle productivity and exacerbate social inequalities.</p>\n<p>I believe integrating both objectives yields optimal outcomes. Cities should designate sufficient areas for parks while simultaneously upgrading transport corridors. For example, linear greenaways alongside bike lanes and bus rapid transit can merge recreational and mobility functions. Such hybrid developments exemplify how urban design can promote sustainability without sacrificing efficiency.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, although public parks and infrastructure serve different needs, their benefits are complementary. Thoughtful urban planning that blends green and built environments will foster healthier, more dynamic</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"vocabulary--expressions\">Vocabulary &amp; Expressions<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-005/#vocabulary--expressions\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Vocabulary &amp; Expressions에 대한 직접 링크\" title=\"Vocabulary &amp; Expressions에 대한 직접 링크\">​</a></h2>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Term / Expression</th><th>Definition</th><th>Simpler Paraphrase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Disparity</strong></td><td>A noticeable difference</td><td>A clear gap</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hydropower</strong></td><td>Power generated from moving water</td><td>Water-based energy</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Geographical constraints</strong></td><td>Limitations due to location or landscape</td><td>Location-based restrictions</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Urban heat islands</strong></td><td>Cities that are significantly warmer than surrounding areas</td><td>City areas that get hotter</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Biodiversity</strong></td><td>Variety of plant and animal life</td><td>Different types of life</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mobility</strong></td><td>Ability to move or be moved freely</td><td>Ease of movement</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hybrid developments</strong></td><td>Projects combining two different functions</td><td>Mixed-use projects</td></tr></tbody></table>",

While some welcome AI for its efficiency and innovation, others express concern over job displacement and ethical implications. I believe that with careful management, AI can offer more advantages than drawbacks.</p>\n<p>However, critics highlight the risks of widespread automation. Many fear that AI could replace workers in sectors such as manufacturing, retail, and transportation, leading to increased unemployment and inequality. Ethical concerns also arise, particularly around data privacy and decision-making transparency.</p>\n<p>In my view, the solution lies in regulation and adaption. Governments should implement policies that retrain displaced workers and ensure AI technologies are used responsibly. Education systems must evolve to prepare future generations with skills that complement AI, such as critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, while AI presents legitimate challenges, its benefits can outweigh the risks if approached thoughtfully. Societies that invest in inclusive, forward-thinking policies will be best positioned to thrive in an AI-integrated future.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"vocabulary--expressions\">Vocabulary &amp; Expressions<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-004/#vocabulary--expressions\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Vocabulary &amp; Expressions에 대한 직접 링크\" title=\"Vocabulary &amp; Expressions에 대한 직접 링크\">​</a></h2>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Term / Expression</th><th>Definition</th><th>Simpler Paraphrase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Displacement</strong></td><td>Being replaced or moved out of a role</td><td>Losing one’s job</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Diagnostics</strong></td><td>Identifying the nature of a medical problem</td><td>Finding out what illness someone has</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Optimize</strong></td><td>Make something work as well as possible</td><td>Make better</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethical concerns</strong></td><td>Worries about right and wrong</td><td>Moral worries</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Decision-making transparency</strong></td><td>How clear and open the process of making choices is</td><td>Easy to see how decisions are made</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Forward-thinking</strong></td><td>Planning for the future with new ideas</td><td>Thinking ahead in a smart way</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Emotional intelligence</strong></td><td>The ability to understand and manage emotions</td><td>Handling emotions well</td></tr></tbody></table>",

Advocates of outer space research argue it drives scientific breakthroughs, while critics assert that immediate needs on Earth warrant priority. I contend that a balanced allocation is crucial.</p>\n<p>Proponents of space programmes emphasize technological innovation. Missions to the Moon and Mars foster advancements in robotics, materials science, and telecommunications, with downstream benefits such as improved medical imaging and environmental monitoring. Furthermore, space exploration inspires future generations in STEM fields and enhances global collaboration on ambitious projects.</p>\n<p>Conversely, opponents argue that pressing problems-such as poverty, climate change, and healthcare-demand urgent resources. With millions lacking basic necessities, critics contend that government budgets should focus on public welfare rather than uncertain extraterrestrial ventures. They point out that excessive spending on space could exacerbate social inequalities and delay solutions to environmental crises.</p>\n<p>In my view, governments should maintain robust support for both domains. A fixed percentage of the budget could be earmarked for space research, ensuring continued innovation, while the remainder addresses critical Earth-bound challenges. Collaborative initiatives, like using satellite technology for disaster relief, demonstrate the synergy between space and terrestrial goals.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, space exploration and solving Earth's problems are not mutually exclusive.

It is clear that South Korea has the highest rate, while Germany records the lowest.</p>\n<p>Specifically, South Korea leads with approximately 70% of its population enrolled in tertiary education. The USA follows at around 45%, and Australia registers a slightly lower rate of approximately 42%. In contrast, Germany's enrollment stands at about 30%, the lowest among the four nations. These figures demonstrate a significant gap of 40 percentage points between South Korea and Germany.</p>\n<p>This disparity may be attributable to differing national policies and cultural emphasis on higher education. South Korea's government has invested heavily in university access and societal norms strongly favour academic achievement, which likely drives its high enrollment. Meanwhile, Germany's dual system of vocational training and apprenticeships provides an alternative pathway, reducing the proportion pursuing university degrees. The intermediate rates in the USA and Australia reflect balanced systems combine academic and vocational opportunities. In summary, while all four are developed countries, their tertiary enrollment rates vary widely due to policy and cultural factors.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"task2\">Task2<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-001/#task2\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Task2에 대한 직접 링크\" title=\"Task2에 대한 직접 링크\">​</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some people argue that online education will eventually replace traditional classroom learning. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Advances in digital technology have fuelled debate over whether online education will supplant traditional classroom learning. While virtual platforms offer flexibility and access, many maintain that face-to-face instruction remains indispensable. In my view, neither mode can fully replace the other; instead, a blended approach is optimal.</p>\n<p>Advocates of online education highlight its convenience. Students can access lectures and materials remotely, accommodating diverse schedules and geographical limitations. Moreover, interactive tools such as discussion forums and quizzes enable self-paced learning and instant feedback. This model reduces travel costs and allows institutions to reach a broader audience, particularly in underserved regions.</p>\n<p>Conversely, proponents of conventional classrooms argue that in-person interaction fosters deeper engagement. Live discussions, hands-on activities and immediate teacher support enhance comprehension and motivation. Classroom environments also build social skills and peer collaboration, which are harder to replicate online. Additionally, maintaining discipline and focus can be more challenging when learners study independently.</p>\n<p>However, insisting on a single approach overlooks their complementary strengths. A blended model combining online lectures with periodic in-person seminars can leverage digital convenience while preserving interactive benefits. For instance, foundational concepts might be taught online, freeing classroom time for discussion and practical application. Such integration not only caters to varied learning styles but also prepares students for a digitally connected world.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, online education and traditional classrooms each offer unique advantages that the other lacks. Rather than viewing one as the inevitable successor, educational stakeholders should embrace a hybrid system to maximize learning outcomes.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"vocabulary--expressions\">Vocabulary &amp; Expressions<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-001/#vocabulary--expressions\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Vocabulary &amp; Expressions에 대한 직접 링크\" title=\"Vocabulary &amp; Expressions에 대한 직접 링크\">​</a></h2>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Term / Expression</th><th>Definition / Paraphrase</th><th>Simpler Paraphrases</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Supplant</strong></td><td>To take the place of something else</td><td>replace</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Fuelled debate</strong></td><td>Caused or intensified discussion</td><td>started or increased discussion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Self-paced learning</strong></td><td>Studying at one’s own speed</td><td>learning at your own speed</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Peer collaboration</strong></td><td>Working together with classmates</td><td>students working together</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Insisting on</strong></td><td>Demanding or maintaining a position</td><td>demanding</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Complementary</strong></td><td>Combining well to enhance each other’s strengths</td><td>working well together</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hybrid system</strong></td><td>A mix of two different methods</td><td>a mixture of both</td></tr></tbody></table>",
