## Task1

> The pie chart above shows the percentage distribution of energy sources in Country X in 2024.

![task1](./assets/ielts-transcription-002.png)

The pie chart illustrates the proportions of different energy sources used in Country X in 2024. It is evident that fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix, although renewable and cleaner alternatives make up a substantial share.

Coal accounts for the largest portion of the energy supply at 34%, followed by natural gas at 25%. Combined, these two fossil fuels represent nearly 60% of total energy consumption. Nuclear power contributes 15%, offering a low-emission but non-renewable option. Hydropower and other renewable sources comprise the remainder, with 10% and 16% respectively.

The data highlights a gradual shift towards sustainable energy. Although coal remains the primary source, renewables slightly exceed nuclear energy in contribution. The presence of hydropower also reflects investment in low-impact infrastructure. However, the high reliance on coal and natural gas suggests the country may face challenges meeting long-term emission targets without significant policy changes.

Overall, while Country X has diversified its energy portfolio, fossil fuels continue to play a central role, indicating both progress and persistent dependence on conventional sources.

## Task2

> Many people believe that economic growth should be the top priority for governments, while others argue that protecting the environment is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

Economic development and environmental conservation are often seen as competing objectives. Advocates of economic growth argue that expanding industries generates jobs, increases GDP, and provides revenue for public services. Developing nations, in particular, rely on rapid industrialization to alleviate poverty and improve infrastructure. On the other hand, environmentalists warn that prioritizing growth can lead to pollution, resource depletion, and climate change, undermining long-term health and stability. I contend that governments should pursue sustainable development: integrating green technologies and regulations to ensure economic progress does not compromise environmental integrity.
