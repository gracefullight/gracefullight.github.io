![task1](./assets/ielts-transcription-002.png)

The pie chart illustrates the distribution of energy sources in Country X in 2024. Overall, fossil fuels dominate the mix, though a notable share comes from cleaner alternatives. Coal represents the largest portion at 34%, followed by natural gas at 25%. Together, these two sources account for nearly 60% of the total. Nuclear energy contributes 15%, while hydro and other renewables make up 10% and 16% respectively. The data indicates a reliance on coal, yet the combined renewable segment (26%) slightly exceeds nuclear output, reflecting early steps toward sustainability.

## Task2

> Many people believe that economic growth should be the top priority for governments, while others argue that protecting the environment is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

Economic development and environmental conservation are often seen as competing objectives. Advocates of economic growth argue that expanding industries generates jobs, increases GDP, and provides revenue for public services. Developing nations, in particular, rely on rapid industrialization to alleviate poverty and improve infrastructure. On the other hand, environmentalists warn that prioritizing growth can lead to pollution, resource depletion, and climate change, undermining long-term health and stability. I contend that governments should pursue sustainable development: integrating green technologies and regulations to ensure economic progress does not compromise environmental integrity.
