## Task1

> The table below shows the percentage of households with internet access in four regions for the years 2010, 2015 and 2020, and the overall change between 2010 and 2020.

| Region | 2010 (%) | 2015 (%) | 2020 (%) | Change (%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| North America | 65 | 80 | 92 | +27 |
| Europe | 58 | 75 | 89 | +31 |
| Asia | 42 | 60 | 75 | +33 |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | 15 | 30 | 48 | +33 |

The table compares household internet access rates in four regions-North America, Europe, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa across 2010, 2015 and 2020, and shows the percentage-point change over the decade. Overall, all regions experienced substantial increases, with Asis and Sub-Saharan Africa recording the largest gains.

In 2010, North America led with 65% access, rising to 92% by 2020, a change of +27 points. Europe followed, increasing from 58% to 89% (+31). Asia saw access climb from 42% to 75% (+33), matching Sub-Saharan Africa's growth, which rose from a low base of 15% to 48% (+33). By 2020, the gap between the highest and lowest regions had narrowed from 50 points in 2010 to 44 points.

The data indicates that developing regions made the most rapid progress, likely due to infrastructure investments and policy initiatives promoting connectivity. In contrast, advanced regions like North America and Europe showed more modest absolute increases, as they began from higher starting points. In summary, while all regions improved, the greatest relative expansion occurred where initial access was lowest.

## Task2

> Some people believe that learning computer programming should be a compulsory part of the school curriculum.
> To what extent do you agree or disagree?

While computer programming offers clear benefits, I disagree that it should be compulsory for all school students. Mandating coding risks overloading curricula, may not suit every leaner, and could divert attention from equally vital subjects.

Firstly, a one-size-fits-all approach can overwhelm students whose strengths lie elsewhere. Not every child has an aptitude for abstract, logical thinking required in programming. Forcing all pupils to learn to code may discourage those who would excel in areas such as the arts, humanities or languages, thereby stifling diverse talents.

Secondly, curriculum time is finite. Introducing compulsory coding would necessitate reducing hours for other core subjects-such as literature, history or the natural sciences-which cultivate critical cultural awareness and scientific literacy. These disciplines are essential for fostering well-rounded individuals and informed citizens.

Finally, effective programming instruction requires skilled teachers and up-to-date resources. Many schools, particularly in under-resourced areas, lack qualified computer science educators and sufficient technological infrastructure. Compulsory coding risks creating superficial, checkbox-style lessons that fail to develop genuine proficiency.

In conclusion, although programming is a valuable skill in our digital age, it should remain an optional subject. Allowing students to choose based on their interests and strengths preserves curriculum balance and respects individual aptitudes, leading to better educational outcomes overall.
