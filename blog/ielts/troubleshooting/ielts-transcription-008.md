The bar chart presents data on the average daily screen time across six age groups in 2024. It is evident that younger individuals spent significantly more time on screens than older age groups.

The highest screen usage was recorded among those aged 10-19, who spent an average of 7.5 hours daily. This figure gradually declined with age: 20-29-year-olds averaged 6.8 hours, while 30-39-year-olds spent around 5.4 hours. The 40-49 age group logged 4.1 hours, and screen time dropped further to 3.2 hours for those aged 50-59. The lowest figure was among those aged 60 and above, with just 2 hours per day.

The data indicates a clear inverse relationship between age and screen usage. Younger age groups particularly teenagers and young adults, are the most active digital users, like due to social media, entertainment, and education-related activities. In contrast, older generations tend to have less engagement with digital devices.

In summary, screen time is strongly age-dependent, with usage decreasing steadily as age increases.
