## D1, Plants

- Do you keep plants at homes?
  - Yes, I do. I have one plant on my living room desk and another on the dining table. I’m not exactly sure what type they are, but I bought them from an online store because I wanted to try growing some plants.
- What plant did you grow when you were young?
  - When I was young, I used to grow vegetables and flowers at home. Sometimes, I’d even pick a few lettuce leaves and enjoy eating them.
- Do you know anything about growing a plant?
  - Well, I don’t know the best growing methods exactly, but I do know the basics. I usually water my plants once a week, keep them near a window for sunlight, and sometimes use fertilizer to enrich the soil.
- Do Chinese people send plants a gifts?
  - Yes, they do. Although I haven’t experienced it personally, I know that Chinese people often give plants as gifts because they symbolize life, prosperity, and beauty.

## D2, Holidays

- Where did you go for your last holiday?
  - I went to Jeju Island because my parents live there. I visited Youngmeori beach with them. The rock formations there are amazing because they were shaped by waves over thousands of years.
- Do you like holidays? Why?
  - I really like holidays because I've worked for ten years and don't get many vacations. So when I have a holiday, I usually go on a short trip abroad with my wife.
- Which public holiday do you like the best?
  - Maybe New Year's Day, because it's the biggest holiday in Korea, and I get to celebrate it with my loved ones.
- What do you do on holidays?
  - Sometimes I go on a short trip to another country, and other times I just want to completely relax at home.
- Do you like to spend your day at home?
  - Yes, as I mentioned earlier, I sometimes like to completely rest at home. I enjoy it because it helps me recharge and get ready for the next week. Plus, watching Netflix with my wife helps me relieve stress.
- Do you prefer a leisure or a busy holiday?
  - It depends on my condition. When I'm feeling good, I love going out, having coffee, and enjoying outdoor activities. But When I'm not, I prefer a leisurely holiday at home.
