## D1, Plants

- Do you keep plants at homes?
  - Yes, I do. I have one plant on my living room desk and another on the dining table. I’m not exactly sure what type they are, but I bought them from an online store because I wanted to try growing some plants.
- What plant did you grow when you were young?
  - When I was young, I used to grow vegetables and flowers at home. Sometimes, I’d even pick a few lettuce leaves and enjoy eating them.
- Do you know anything about growing a plant?
  - Well, I don’t know the best growing methods exactly, but I do know the basics. I usually water my plants once a week, keep them near a window for sunlight, and sometimes use fertilizer to enrich the soil.
- Do Chinese people send plants a gifts?
  - Yes, they do. Although I haven’t experienced it personally, I know that Chinese people often give plants as gifts because they symbolize life, prosperity, and beauty.
