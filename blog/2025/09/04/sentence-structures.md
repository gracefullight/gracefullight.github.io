## Types of sentence structure

> The secret to good writing is variation and using a mix of these types of sentences within your paragraphs in your written work.

- Simple sentence
  - is one independent clause in a subject-verb pattern
  - e.g. The Australian government introduced an official carbon tax on 1 July 2012.
- Compound sentence
  - is two independent clauses connected by a coordinating conjunction.
  - e.g. The Australian government introduced an official carbon tax on 1 July 2012, but this was met with opposition from the general public.
- **Complex sentence**
  - consists of an independent clause and a dependent clause.
  - e.g. As the Australian government recognized the necessity to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it introduced an official carbon tax on 1 July 2012.
- **Compound-complex sentences**
  - consists of more than one independent clause and one or more dependent clauses
  - e.g. As the Australian government recognized the necessity to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it introduced an offical carbon tax on 1 July 2012, but this was met with opposition from the general public.

## Common sentence structure errors

### Sentence fragments

- A sentence fragment is missing some of its parts.
- There are three main reasons why a sentence may be incomplete.
  - Missing subject
    - e.g Becoming extinct because of rising sea tempratures.
    - Correction: Phytoplankton could become extinct because of rising sea temperatures.
  - Missing verb
    - e.g. Significantly, one particular form of Western Australian finch.
    - Correction: Significantly, one particular form of Western Austrailan finch has decreased in numbers.
  - Incomplete thought
    - e.g. In a recent article about loss of habitat due to climate change.
    - Correction: In a recent article about loss of habitat due to climate change, Australian animals were shown to be particularly vulnerable.
- Sentences beginning with words like so, as, because, who, which, that are often incomplete.

### Run-on sentences

- A run-on sentence occurs when two simple sentences are incorrectly joined.
  e.g. Poverty, famine and major public health problems around the developing world are important indicators of a changing climate these issues are not being addressed globally.
- Use a joining or linking word such as and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet.
  - Correction: Poverty, famine and major public health problems around the developing world are important indicators of a changing climate, **but** these issues are not being addressed globally.
- Make two separate sentences.
  - Correction: Poverty, famine and major public health problems around the devleoping world are important indicators of a chaing climate. These issues are not being addressed globally.

### Lack of Meaning

- Ensure that each sentence you write has clear meaning in English.
- It must be fully understandable when read.
- If you ware not sure if your sentence has clear meaning in English, perhaps think about rewriting it in a simpler and clearer way that you can fully understand (as will hopefully your reader).

## Tips for writing

- Consider the following example where each sentence follows a similar structure.
  - Topic Sentence: main point of the paragraph.
  - Supporting Sentence: Examples, evidence, or analysis.
  - Concluding Sentence: wrap up paragraph by linking to broader topic, or linking to the next paragraph or section.
- This uniformity leads to a lack of cohesion, making the paragraph feel disjointed and somewhat monotonous.
  - e.g. Nursing education states that measures should be in place to avoid infection. Also, that infection rates tend to soar when hygiene standards decrease. Appropriate steps should be taken to decrease these risks. It is suggested that medical staff are educated to understand these risks.
  - Correction: Nursing educators argue that strict measures should be implemented to avoid infection in medical institutions. There is also much evidence to demonstrate that infection rates rise dramatically when hygiene standards begin to fall. Therefore, it is argued that appropriate steps need to be in place to decrease and minimize these potential risks. Furthermore, aggressive steps should be taken to ensure that all staff maintain effective hygiene and infection control.
