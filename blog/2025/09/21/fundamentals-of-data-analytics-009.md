## Linear Separability

- the data is linearly separable if
  - it can be separated by a point on a single dimension line of data points
  - by a line on a two-dimensional representation of data points
  - by a plane (a two-dimensional surface) in a three-dimensional representation of the data points
- If it is non-linearly separable, look at other options for classification.

### Hyperplane

- the conceptual divide between data
