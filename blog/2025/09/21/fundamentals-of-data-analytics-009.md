## Linear Separability

- the data is linearly separable if
  - it can be separated by a point on a single dimension line of data points
  - by a line on a two-dimensional representation of data points
  - by a plane (a two-dimensional surface) in a three-dimensional representation of the data points
- If it is non-linearly separable, look at other options for classification.

### Hyperplane

- the conceptual divide between data
- **Weight vector**: represented and generated in weight space.
- Choosing the hyperplane
  - Minimum distance between samples
  - Least-squares method
  - Gradient Descent

## Artificial Neural Networks, ANN

- Strength: for high dimensionality problems, the complex relations between variables
- Weaknesses: theoretically complex, computationally intensive, needs large data sets, complicated to implement
- Kinds of ANN
  - Perceptrons, Multilayer Perceptrons
  - Deep learning neural networks
  - Kohonen networks
  - Convolutional neural networks
  - Radial Basis Functions
  - Recurrent neural networks
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Competitive learning
  - Boltzmann machines
