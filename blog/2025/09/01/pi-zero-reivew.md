## π0

## Problem & Motivation

- Achieving real-world generality in robot learning is blocked by **data scarcity, generalization, and robustness** limits.
- Human intelligence most outpaces machines in **versatility**—solving diverse, physically situated tasks under constraints, language commands, and perturbations.
- In NLP/CV, **foundation models** pre-trained on diverse multi-task data, then **fine-tuned (aligned)** on curated datasets, outperform narrow specialists; the same paradigm is hypothesized for robotics.

## Core Proposal

- A **novel flow-matching architecture** built on a pre-trained **Vision-Language Model (VLM)** to inherit Internet-scale semantics.
- Further training adds **robot actions**, turning the model into a **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** policy.
- Use **cross-embodiment training** to combine data from many robot types (single/dual-arm, mobile), despite differing configuration/action spaces.
- Employ **action chunking** + **flow matching** (diffusion variant) to model complex, continuous, high-frequency actions.
- Introduce an **Action Expert** (separate weights for action/state tokens), akin to a **Mixture-of-Experts**, augmenting the standard VLM.

## Training Recipe (Pre- vs Post-Training)

- **Pre-training** on highly diverse data builds broad, general physical abilities.
- **Post-training** on curated, task-specific data instills **fluent, efficient strategies**.
- Rationale: high-quality-only training lacks recovery behaviors; low-quality-only training lacks efficiency/robustness; **combining both** yields desired behavior.

## Data & Backbone

- ~**10,000 hours** of demonstrations + the **OXE** dataset; data spans **7 robot configurations** and **68 tasks**.
- VLM backbone initialized from **PaliGemma (3B)**; add **~300M** parameters for the action expert (total **~3.3B**).
- Pre-training mixture: weighted combination of internal datasets + full OXE; **n^0.43** weighting to down-weight overrepresented task-robot pairs.
- Unify interfaces: zero-pad **qt/at** to the largest robot dimension (18); mask missing image slots; late-fusion encoders map images/states to the same token space as language.

## Modeling Details

- **Conditional flow matching** models the continuous distribution over action chunks.
- Train with a **diffusion-style loss** on individual sequence elements (instead of cross-entropy), with separate weights for diffusion-related tokens.
- Flow path uses a **linear-Gaussian** schedule; sample noisy actions with ε∼N(0, I); predict denoising vector field; **Euler integration** from τ=0→1 at inference.
- Efficient inference by **caching** K/V for the observation prefix; action tokens recomputed per integration step.

## High-Level Language Policy

- Because the policy consumes language, a **high-level VLM** can decompose tasks (e.g., bussing) into intermediate language subgoals (SayCan-style planning), improving performance on complex, temporally extended tasks.

## Evaluation Setup & Baselines

- **Out-of-box** (direct prompting), **fine-tuning** on downstream tasks, and **with high-level VLM** providing intermediate commands.
- Compare against **OpenVLA (7B, autoregressive discretization; no action chunks/high-frequency control)** and **Octo (93M; diffusion)**, trained on the same mixture.
- Include a **compute-parity** π0 (160k steps vs 700k) and a **π0-small** variant (no VLM init).

## Key Results

- **Out-of-box**: π0 outperforms all baselines; even compute-parity π0 beats OpenVLA/Octo; π0-small still surpasses them—highlighting the benefits of **expressive architectures + diffusion/flow matching + VLM pre-training**.
- **Language following**: π0 clearly exceeds π0-small across conditions:
  - **π0-flat**: only overall task command.
  - **π0-human**: human-provided intermediate steps.
  - **π0-HL**: high-level VLM-provided steps (fully autonomous).
  - Better language-following accuracy **directly translates** into stronger autonomous performance with high-level guidance.
- **New dexterous tasks** (e.g., bowls stacking, towel folding, microwave, drawer items, paper towel replacement):
  - Fine-tuned π0 generally outperforms **OpenVLA**, **Octo**, and small-data methods **ACT** / **Diffusion Policy**.
  - Pre-training helps most when tasks resemble pre-training data; pretrained π0 often beats from-scratch by up to **2×**.
- **Complex multi-stage tasks** (laundry folding, table bussing, box building, to-go box, eggs):
  - π0 solves many tasks; **full pre-training + fine-tuning** performs best.
  - Gains from pre-training are **especially large** on harder tasks; absolute performance varies with task difficulty and pre-training coverage.

## Takeaways & Limitations

- π0 mirrors LLM training: **pre-train for knowledge**, **post-train for alignment** (instruction-following and execution).
- Limitations/open questions:
  - Optimal **composition/weighting** of pre-training data remains unclear.
  - Not all tasks work reliably; difficult to predict **how much/what kind** of data is needed for near-perfect performance.
  - Uncertain **positive transfer** across very diverse tasks/robots and to distinct domains (e.g., driving, navigation, legged locomotion).
