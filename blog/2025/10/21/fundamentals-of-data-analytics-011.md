## Bias

- Bias quantifies how much on average the predicted values differ from the actual values.
- High bias implies the model is under-performing.

## Variance

- Variance quantifies how sensitive the model is to small changes in the training samples.

## Ensemble Methods

- The intuition behind ensemble methods is to decrease bias and variance by using multiple machine learning algorithms.
- Any machine learning algorithm can be used in ensemble methods.
  - decision trees, neural networks, logistic regressions, etc.
