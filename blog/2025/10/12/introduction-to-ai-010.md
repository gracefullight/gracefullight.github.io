## Knnowledge representation

- Intelligent agents need knowledge about the world in order to reach good decisions.
- Declarative knowledge is represented in a form of sentences in a knowledge representation language and stored in a knowledge base.
- Knowledge base is used by an inference engine to infer a new sentence which will be used for the agent to decide what action to take next.
- Formal languages are defined by its grammar and semantic rules
  - **grammar**: defines the syntax of legal sentences
  - **semantic rules**: defines the meaning.
- Common knowledge representation formalisms:
  - **Propositional logic**
  - **First-order logic**
  - Fuzzy logic
  - Semantic networks
  - Ontologies
