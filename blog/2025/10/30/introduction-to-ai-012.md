## Structural Knowledge

- Structural knowledge: the relationship between concepts and objects in the world.
- Hierarchical approach: built on classification and uses hierarchies as the structures for knowledge representation, presented in a graphical format.
  - Semantic networks: nodes represent concepts, and edges represent relationships between concepts.
  - Ontologies: classes, subclasses, and properties to represent knowledge in a domain.
