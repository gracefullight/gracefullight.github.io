## Overview

- Yarn berry was all the rage.
- I tried it and found quite a few problems, which is why I ended up choosing pnpm.

## Problems

### zipfs

- It stores all the packages and logs all the diffs. This is a major culprit for repository size. Difficult to manage images under 1GB.
- If typescript goes up, yarn berry version should go up. I want to use the latest syntax in typescript right away, but I can't keep up.
- I need to update the executable with `yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode` whenever typescript, eslint, and prettier are released.
- In a project with 20+ front-end developers, this is hard to enforce.
- It is not possible to test this by making small changes to the source inside the package.

### opensource

- Monolithic tools like turbo, environments with postinstall hooks like prism, or preset configurators like `create-*` reference `node_modules` directly.
- Often it won't even run, and you'll have to wait for an open issue in each repo. I'm not writing this to analyze yarn berry's pnp script.
- In this case, I'd have to give it a `nodeLinker` and use it the same way I would with yarn 1, with no advantage.

### workspaces

- The yarn workspaces feature is cool, and [yarnpkg/berry](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry) is a perfect example of it.
- But it's only cool if you're only developing node.js libraries. Libraries for the frontend need a bundler, and there's no reference for that.

## Benchmarks

- Benchmark scores are managed by Pnpm on a daily basis.
- Slowness is acceptable with pipeline cache and lock files enabled. It's a one-time slowdown, not a request/response slowdown, so it can be handled by probes anyway.

## Conclusion

- The plugin features in yarn berry are cool, but they add more stress to dependency management.
