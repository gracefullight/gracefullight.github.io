## Overview

Here's a list of use cases where you can get past the hype and actually use it for something useful.

## Extracting regular expressions

Creating regular expressions usually involves a lot of testing.
I usually put the desired text in regexr, regex101, and match the negative/positive lookahead from memory, and use negative/positive lookbehind, but often find that negative lookbehind is not supported by different programming versions/languages.

Now I ask ChatGPT. Suppose you want to extract the package name from the package update history below.

```txt
Hello GPT.

Can you give me a regex pattern for getting to-be result?

as-is:
Orignal content


to-be:
Refined string #1
Refined string #2
...and so on.
```

It will get it for you.

## Writing documentation with code

If you want your code to be documented, put it in and ask it to create a README.md.

```
Can you write a README.md with this code?
```

It will get it for you.

## Create an Object Validation Schema with the interface

Let's create a Joi Schema with a TypeScript interface.

## Create a Query DSL with Raw SQL

Pass in a raw query and ask it to create a query DSL and query helper syntax.

## Create a DDL with Data

Pass in a query and ask it to generate a table schema query like the interface example above.
