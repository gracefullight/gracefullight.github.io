## 백년허리

I got a herniated disc from Sumo-deadlift, and I think it would be good for many people to read this before it happens.
If I had, I would have had a good posture before the disc between L5-S1 came out.

The overall content is a book review of [백년허리](https://link.coupang.com/a/MTwds) to protect spinal hygiene.

## Diagnosis

- Vertebrae: Cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccyx
  - The cervical and lumbar vertebrae are curved forward, with cervical lordosis and lumbar lordosis.
- Disc damage is the main cause of back pain
- Discs: Nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus, and endplates
  - The posterior annulus fibrosus and endplates are most commonly injured
- Muscles protect the torn disc.
  - When a disc tears, the muscles tighten to protect it.
  - Low back pain is a sign of a torn disc
- Lumbar lordosis is a new posture.
- A healthy disc creates a lumbar lordosis curve, and the lumbar lordosis curve protects the disc.
- Sciatica is a typical symptom of a herniated disc and is a sign that the disc has herniated.

## Treatment

- The idea that you can cure a bad back by doing stronger back exercises is like saying that you can cure a broken arm by exercising the arm muscles.
- The hip muscles and obliques are important.
- You need to know exactly how much impact your workout will have on your back, and make sure your back can handle the strain.
- Stretches that bend at the waist are very bad exercises for lumbar lordosis
- Stiffness in the lower back when a disc injury is healing is a natural part of the process of the wound turning into scarring.
- It's essential to regain lumbar lordosis through frequent standing and extension movements.
- It is spinal hygiene to try to never re-tear a disc wound as it heals.
- Maintaining lumbar lordosis 24 hours a day
- If you suffer from sciatica when doing lumbar lordosis, you should treat the nerve root inflammation and practice good spinal hygiene.
- Leaning on a backrest or cushion is an advantage.
- The basics of spinal hygiene are maximum lumbar lordosis and extension movements.
- If it hurts to do extension movements, lie on your stomach and do them frequently, for about 5 minutes, with your elbows under your shoulders.
- Lumbar lordosis should not collapse when standing, sitting, or bending at the waist.
- Your back is most comfortable when your knees are slightly lower than your pelvis.
- There is no such thing as a bad back. Your back improves with good posture.
- Standing lumbar lordosis: place your hands on your waist and hold for 5 seconds while breathing.
- Standing Chest: Standing, lift your chest and grab your shoulder blades. No duckbills
- Walking: keep both shoulder blades together, open chest, chin up, graceful chin and proud chest.
- Sitting: knees should be lower than the pelvis. Sit with an upright chest.
  - The height of the screen should be high enough.
  - When sitting with good spinal alignment, you should be able to see the screen without bending your back and neck too much.
- The best place for a lumbar strap is between the 3rd and 4th lumbar vertebrae.
- Avoid the knees.

## Prohibited positions

- Squatting
- Sitting long
- Cross-legged
- Slouching
