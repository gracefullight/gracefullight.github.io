<blockquote>
<p>The increasing use of social media among young people has raised concerns about its impact on mental health. What are the main causes of this issue, and what measures can be taken to address it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The growing prevalence of social media among young people has sparked concerns about its detrimental effects on mental health. This essay will explore the primary causes of this issue and propose effective solutions to mitigate its impact.</p>
<p>One major cause is the pressure to conform to idealized online personas. Social media platforms often showcase curated lifestyles, leading to comparison and feelings of inadequacy among young users. For instance, exposure to influencers' polished images can trigger low self-esteem or anxiety. Additionally, excessive screen time, particularly late at night, disrupts sleep patterns, exacerbating stress and metal fatigue. Cyberbullying is another significant factor, as negative comments or harassment online can profoundly affect emotional well-being, especially among adolescents.</p>
<p>To address these issues, educational initiatives should be implemented to promote digital literacy. Schools could teach young people to critically evaluate social media content and recognize its artificial nature, reducing the urge to compare. For example, programs in Australia have successfully integrated media literacy into curricula, fostering healthier online habits. Governments and platforms should also enforce stricter anti-cyberbullying measures, such as real-time moderation and reporting systems. Furthermore, parents and schools can encourage balanced screen time by promoting offline activities, such as sports or hobbies, to enhance mental resilience.</p>
<p>In conclusion, social media's impact on young people's mental health stems from comparison, excessive use, and cyberbullying. By fostering digital literacy, strengthening platform regulations, and encouraging offline engagement, societies can alleviate these effects, ensuring young people maintain healthier relationships with social media.</p>

<p>The pie charts illustrate the distribution of household expenditure across four categories-housing, food, transport, and other-in a country in 2015 and 2020. Overall, there was a noticeable shift in spending patterns, with food and transport increasing in proportion while housing and other expenses declined.</p>
<p>In 2015, housing accounted for the largest share at 35% followed by food at 25%, and both transport and other categories at 20% each. By 2020, food expenditure rose to 30%, equalling housing, which decreased to 30%. Transport expenditure increased to 25%, while the "other" category saw a reduction to 15%.</p>
<p>The most significant change was the 5-percentage-point increase in food expenditure, reflecting its growing importance in household budgets. Transport also gained prominence, rising by 5 percentage points, whereas housing lost its dominant position. The decline in the "other" category suggests a reallocation of funds toward essential expenses, likely driven by economic or lifestyle changes over the five-year period.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people believe that governments should invest heavily in public transportation to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. Others argue that improving road infrastructure is a more effective solution.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The debate over whether governments should prioritize public transportation or road infrastructure to address traffic congestion and pollution is multifaceted. Both approaches have merit, but their effectiveness depends on context. This essay will discuss both perspectives and present my own view.</p>
<p>Advocates of public transportation argue that it offers a sustainable solution to urban challenges. Efficient systems like buses, trains, and subways can transport large numbers of people, reducing the number of private vehicles on roads. For instance, cities like Tokyo have invested in extensive metro systems, significantly lowering per-capita emissions and easing traffic flow. Public transport is also more accessible to lower-income groups, promoting social equity. Furthermore, modern electric buses and trains can substantially reduce pollution, aligning with environmental goals.</p>
<p>Conversely, proponents of road infrastructure improvements argue that better roads enhance traffic efficiency. Widening highways, building flyovers, or implementing smart traffic systems can alleviate bottlenecks, as seen in cities like Dubai, where advanced road networks reduce travel times. Critics of public transport investments note that such projects are costly and time-consuming, and may not address immediate congestion issues in rapidly growing urban areas.</p>
<p>In my opinion, investing in public transportation is more effective in the long term. It addresses both congestion and pollution while promoting sustainable urban development. However, strategic road improvements can complement these efforts, particularly in areas with limited public transport infrastructure. A balanced approach, prioritizing public transport with targeted road enhancements, offers the most holistic solution to urban mobility challenges.</div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class=col><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_I9gl padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class=tag_gTs5><a rel=tag title="International English Language Testing System" class="tag_QmFV tagRegular_P3VH" href=/en/tags/ielts/>ielts</a></ul></div></footer></article><article class=margin-bottom--xl><header><h2 class=title_oc8d><a href=/en/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-009/>IELTS Transcription +009</a></h2><div class="container_OrIy margin-vert--md"><time datetime=2025-07-20T05:12:28.966Z>July 20, 2025</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_wGk4"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href=https://github.com/gracefullight target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" class=avatar__photo-link><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_vBZr" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11773683?v=4" alt=Gracefullight /></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_rwrS"><div class=avatar__name><a href=https://github.com/gracefullight target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=authorName_D1HT translate=no>Gracefullight</span></a></div><small class=authorTitle_Ydry title=Owner>Owner</small><div class=authorSocials_Ed3g></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class=markdown><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_GkGg" id=task1>Task1<a href=#task1 class=hash-link aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading" translate=no>​</a></h2>

<p>The table compares household internet access rates in four regions-North America, Europe, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa across 2010, 2015 and 2020, and shows the percentage-point change over the decade. Overall, all regions experienced substantial increases, with Asis and Sub-Saharan Africa recording the largest gains.</p>
<p>In 2010, North America led with 65% access, rising to 92% by 2020, a change of +27 points. Europe followed, increasing from 58% to 89% (+31). Asia saw access climb from 42% to 75% (+33), matching Sub-Saharan Africa's growth, which rose from a low base of 15% to 48% (+33). By 2020, the gap between the highest and lowest regions had narrowed from 50 points in 2010 to 44 points.</p>
<p>The data indicates that developing regions made the most rapid progress, likely due to infrastructure investments and policy initiatives promoting connectivity. In contrast, advanced regions like North America and Europe showed more modest absolute increases, as they began from higher starting points. In summary, while all regions improved, the greatest relative expansion occurred where initial access was lowest.</p>

<p>Some people believe that learning computer programming should be a compulsory part of the school curriculum.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While computer programming offers clear benefits, I disagree that it should be compulsory for all school students. Mandating coding risks overloading curricula, may not suit every leaner, and could divert attention from equally vital subjects.</p>
<p>Firstly, a one-size-fits-all approach can overwhelm students whose strengths lie elsewhere. Not every child has an aptitude for abstract, logical thinking required in programming. Forcing all pupils to learn to code may discourage those who would excel in areas such as the arts, humanities or languages, thereby stifling diverse talents.</p>
<p>Secondly, curriculum time is finite. Introducing compulsory coding would necessitate reducing hours for other core subjects-such as literature, history or the natural sciences-which cultivate critical cultural awareness and scientific literacy. These disciplines are essential for fostering well-rounded individuals and informed citizens.</p>
<p>Finally, effective programming instruction requires skilled teachers and up-to-date resources. Many schools, particularly in under-resourced areas, lack qualified computer science educators and sufficient technological infrastructure. Compulsory coding risks creating superficial, checkbox-style lessons that fail to develop genuine proficiency.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although programming is a valuable skill in our digital age, it should remain an optional subject. Allowing students to choose based on their interests and strengths preserves curriculum balance and respects individual aptitudes, leading to better educational outcomes overall.</p>

<p>The bar chart presents data on the average daily screen time across six age groups in 2024. It is evident that younger individuals spent significantly more time on screens than older age groups.</p>
<p>The highest screen usage was recorded among those aged 10-19, who spent an average of 7.5 hours daily. This figure gradually declined with age: 20-29-year-olds averaged 6.8 hours, while 30-39-year-olds spent around 5.4 hours. The 40-49 age group logged 4.1 hours, and screen time dropped further to 3.2 hours for those aged 50-59. The lowest figure was among those aged 60 and above, with just 2 hours per day.</p>
<p>The data indicates a clear inverse relationship between age and screen usage. Younger age groups particularly teenagers and young adults, are the most active digital users, like due to social media, entertainment, and education-related activities. In contrast, older generations tend to have less engagement with digital devices.</p>
<p>In summary, screen time is strongly age-dependent, with usage decreasing steadily as age increases.</p>

In addition, online communities can offer support for individuals with shared interests or rare conditions, especially those who might struggle with in-person interactions.</p>
<p>Conversely, critics argue that digital communication has replaced face-to-face interaction. They claim that excessive use of social media may result in superficial relationships, reduced empathy, and a decline in real-world social skills. Furthermore, people who spend long hours online may neglect relationships in their immediate environment.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the key lies in how the internet is used. When leveraged wisely, it enhances human connection by bridging geographical gaps and providing new forms of interaction. However, overreliance on online communication at the expense of physical presence can lead to emotional distance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the internet can potentially isolate individuals, its overall effect has been to bring people closer-provided it is used to complement, rather than replace, real-life relationships.</p>

<p>Some people believe that online education is as effective as traditional classroom learning.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the rise of digital platforms, online education has gained significant popularity. While some argue that it matches traditional learning in quality, other remain skeptical. I believe that while online learning offers valuable flexibility, it is not yet a full substitute for classroom-based education.</p>
<p>One major strength of online education is accessibility. Students from remote or underserved areas can access high-quality resources without the need to travel. In addition, digital platforms often allow learners to progress at their own pace and review material repeatedly, which can enhance understanding.</p>
<p>However, traditional classrooms offer vital social and interactive components that online platforms often lack. Real-time discussions, immediate feedback from teachers, and group activities foster deeper engagement and critical thinking. Furthermore, hands-on subjects such as science or art often require physical presence and equipment, which are difficult to replicate virtually.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a blended model that incorporates both formats is the most effective. Online tools cna supplement in-person instruction, offering convenience while maintaining academic rigor and interpersonal interaction.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although online education has considerable advantages, it cannot entirely replace the rich, dynamic experience of traditional classrooms. A hybrid approach is likely to yield the best educational outcomes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people think it is more important to focus on the present, while others believe planning for the future is essential
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an ongoing debate over whether people should prioritize living in the moment or concentrate on future planning. While present-focused individuals argue for making the most of today, others maintain that long-term thinking is vital for success. I believe both perspectives have merit and should be balanced.</p>
<p>Advocates of living in the present argue that focusing on the now enhances happiness and reduces anxiety. They contend that excessive worry about the future can lead to missed opportunities and mental stress. Mindfulness practices, which encourage awareness of the present moment, have been shown to improve emotional well-being and foster gratitude.</p>
<p>In contrast, those who support planning ahead believe that setting goals and preparing for possible challenges ensures greater stability. Financial planning, career development, and health maintenance all require foresight. Without long-term thinking, people may struggle tot achieve lasting success or face avoidable setbacks.</p>
<p>In my view, the most effective approach integrates both attitudes. While it is essential to enjoy and engage with daily life, planning for the future provides direction and security. For example, saving money for retirement does not prevent someone from enjoying today's experiences, but rather ensures peace of mind in the long run.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while it is beneficial to embrace the present, neglecting future planning can lead to adverse consequences. A balanced mindset that values both present enjoyment and future preparedness is key to a fulfilling life.</p>

<p>The bar chart compares the installed renewable energy capacity of five sources in Country Z in 2023. It is evident that hydro power leads significantly, whereas geothermal contributes the least.</p>
<p>Hydro energy accounts for the largest capacity at 80 GW. Wind follows with 60 GW, and solar stands at 45 Gw. Biomass has a modest capacity of 20 GW, while geothermal sits at 10 GW, the smallest share. Overall, hydro capacity is four times that of geothermal and double that of wind, indicating a heavy reliance on water-based power generation.</p>
<p>The disparity among success suggests strategic priorities and resource availability. Country Z's abundant river systems likely facilitate extensive hydro installations. Meanwhile, moderate wind and solar capacities reflect ongoing investments, and lower biomass and geothermal figures may be due to technological or geographical constraints. In summary, although Country Z is diversifying its renewable portfolio, the energy mix remains dominated by hydropower.</p>

<p>Some people believe that governments should prioritize investing in public parks and green spaces to enhance urban living, while others argue that funds should be allocated to infrastructure such as roads and public transport.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Urban planners often debate the allocation of municipal funds between green spaces and infrastructure development. Advocates of public parks emphasize health and environmental benefits, whereas proponents of roads and transit prioritize economic growth and mobility. I maintain that a balanced approach best serves urban populations.</p>
<p>Supporters of green spaces argue that parks improve air quality, reduce urban heat islands, and provide recreational areas crucial for physical and mental well-being. Studies show access to green spaces correlates with lower stress levels and enhanced community cohesion. Additionally, urban greenery can support biodiversity and stormwater management.</p>
<p>Conversely, those favouring infrastructure investments contend that efficient roads and public transport systems drive economic activity, reduce congestion, and enhance accessibility. Well-maintained transport networks facilitate commerce and connect residential areas with employment hubs. In rapidly growing cities, inadequate infrastructure can stifle productivity and exacerbate social inequalities.</p>
<p>I believe integrating both objectives yields optimal outcomes. Cities should designate sufficient areas for parks while simultaneously upgrading transport corridors. For example, linear greenaways alongside bike lanes and bus rapid transit can merge recreational and mobility functions. Such hybrid developments exemplify how urban design can promote sustainability without sacrificing efficiency.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although public parks and infrastructure serve different needs, their benefits are complementary. Thoughtful urban planning that blends green and built environments will foster healthier, more dynamic</p>

<p>Some people believe that governments should invest heavily in space exploration, whereas others think those funds are better spent on solving problems on Earth. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The debase over funding space exploration versus addressing terrestrial issues has persisted for decades. Advocates of outer space research argue it drives scientific breakthroughs, while critics assert that immediate needs on Earth warrant priority. I contend that a balanced allocation is crucial.</p>
<p>Proponents of space programmes emphasize technological innovation. Missions to the Moon and Mars foster advancements in robotics, materials science, and telecommunications, with downstream benefits such as improved medical imaging and environmental monitoring. Furthermore, space exploration inspires future generations in STEM fields and enhances global collaboration on ambitious projects.</p>
<p>Conversely, opponents argue that pressing problems-such as poverty, climate change, and healthcare-demand urgent resources. With millions lacking basic necessities, critics contend that government budgets should focus on public welfare rather than uncertain extraterrestrial ventures. They point out that excessive spending on space could exacerbate social inequalities and delay solutions to environmental crises.</p>
<p>In my view, governments should maintain robust support for both domains. A fixed percentage of the budget could be earmarked for space research, ensuring continued innovation, while the remainder addresses critical Earth-bound challenges. Collaborative initiatives, like using satellite technology for disaster relief, demonstrate the synergy between space and terrestrial goals.</p>
<p>In conclusion, space exploration and solving Earth's problems are not mutually exclusive. Through prudent budgeting and interdisciplinary projects, societies can advance scientific frontiers while safeguarding human welfare.</p>
