What are the main causes of this issue, and what measures can be taken to address it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The growing prevalence of social media among young people has sparked concerns about its detrimental effects on mental health. This essay will explore the primary causes of this issue and propose effective solutions to mitigate its impact.</p>\n<p>One major cause is the pressure to conform to idealized online personas. Social media platforms often showcase curated lifestyles, leading to comparison and feelings of inadequacy among young users. For instance, exposure to influencers' polished images can trigger low self-esteem or anxiety. Additionally, excessive screen time, particularly late at night, disrupts sleep patterns, exacerbating stress and metal fatigue. Cyberbullying is another significant factor, as negative comments or harassment online can profoundly affect emotional well-being, especially among adolescents.</p>\n<p>To address these issues, educational initiatives should be implemented to promote digital literacy. Schools could teach young people to critically evaluate social media content and recognize its artificial nature, reducing the urge to compare. For example, programs in Australia have successfully integrated media literacy into curricula, fostering healthier online habits. Governments and platforms should also enforce stricter anti-cyberbullying measures, such as real-time moderation and reporting systems. Furthermore, parents and schools can encourage balanced screen time by promoting offline activities, such as sports or hobbies, to enhance mental resilience.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, social media's impact on young people's mental health stems from comparison, excessive use, and cyberbullying. By fostering digital literacy, strengthening platform regulations, and encouraging offline engagement, societies can alleviate these effects, ensuring young people maintain healthier relationships with social media.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"vocabulary--expressions\">Vocabulary &amp; Expressions<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/en/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-011/#vocabulary--expressions\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to heading\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Term/Expression</th><th>Definition</th><th>Simpler Paraphrase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>prominence</strong></td><td>The state of being important or noticeable</td><td>Importance</td></tr><tr><td><strong>conform</strong></td><td>To comply with rules or standards</td><td>Follow</td></tr><tr><td><strong>detrimental</strong></td><td>Causing harm or damage</td><td>Harmful</td></tr><tr><td><strong>exacerbating</strong></td><td>Making a problem or situation worse</td><td>Worsening</td></tr><tr><td><strong>resilience</strong></td><td>The ability to recover quickly from difficulties</td><td>Strength</td></tr><tr><td><strong>alleviate</strong></td><td>To make something less severe or intense</td><td>Reduce</td></tr><tr><td><strong>penetration</strong></td><td>The extent to which something is adopted or spread</td><td>Spread</td></tr><tr><td><strong>disparities</strong></td><td>Significant differences or inequalities</td><td>Gaps</td></tr></tbody></table>",

Others argue that improving road infrastructure is a more effective solution.\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The debate over whether governments should prioritize public transportation or road infrastructure to address traffic congestion and pollution is multifaceted. Both approaches have merit, but their effectiveness depends on context. This essay will discuss both perspectives and present my own view.</p>\n<p>Advocates of public transportation argue that it offers a sustainable solution to urban challenges. Efficient systems like buses, trains, and subways can transport large numbers of people, reducing the number of private vehicles on roads. For instance, cities like Tokyo have invested in extensive metro systems, significantly lowering per-capita emissions and easing traffic flow. Public transport is also more accessible to lower-income groups, promoting social equity. Furthermore, modern electric buses and trains can substantially reduce pollution, aligning with environmental goals.</p>\n<p>Conversely, proponents of road infrastructure improvements argue that better roads enhance traffic efficiency. Widening highways, building flyovers, or implementing smart traffic systems can alleviate bottlenecks, as seen in cities like Dubai, where advanced road networks reduce travel times. Critics of public transport investments note that such projects are costly and time-consuming, and may not address immediate congestion issues in rapidly growing urban areas.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, investing in public transportation is more effective in the long term. It addresses both congestion and pollution while promoting sustainable urban development. However, strategic road improvements can complement these efforts, particularly in areas with limited public transport infrastructure. A balanced approach, prioritizing public transport with targeted road enhancements, offers the most holistic solution to urban mobility challenges.</p>",

In summary, while all regions improved, the greatest relative expansion occurred where initial access was lowest.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"task2\">Task2<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/en/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-009/#task2\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to heading\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some people believe that learning computer programming should be a compulsory part of the school curriculum.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While computer programming offers clear benefits, I disagree that it should be compulsory for all school students. Mandating coding risks overloading curricula, may not suit every leaner, and could divert attention from equally vital subjects.</p>\n<p>Firstly, a one-size-fits-all approach can overwhelm students whose strengths lie elsewhere. Not every child has an aptitude for abstract, logical thinking required in programming. Forcing all pupils to learn to code may discourage those who would excel in areas such as the arts, humanities or languages, thereby stifling diverse talents.</p>\n<p>Secondly, curriculum time is finite. Introducing compulsory coding would necessitate reducing hours for other core subjects-such as literature, history or the natural sciences-which cultivate critical cultural awareness and scientific literacy. These disciplines are essential for fostering well-rounded individuals and informed citizens.</p>\n<p>Finally, effective programming instruction requires skilled teachers and up-to-date resources. Many schools, particularly in under-resourced areas, lack qualified computer science educators and sufficient technological infrastructure. Compulsory coding risks creating superficial, checkbox-style lessons that fail to develop genuine proficiency.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, although programming is a valuable skill in our digital age, it should remain an optional subject. Allowing students to choose based on their interests and strengths preserves curriculum balance and respects individual aptitudes, leading to better educational outcomes overall.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"vocabulary--expressions\">Vocabulary &amp; Expressions<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/en/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-009/#vocabulary--expressions\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to heading\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Term/Expression</th><th>Definition</th><th>Simpler Paraphrase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>A one-size-fits-all</strong></td><td>Designed to apply universally without variation</td><td>Same for everyone</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Abstract thinking</strong></td><td>Thinking about ideas and concepts rather than concrete facts</td><td>Thinking about ideas</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Stifling</strong></td><td>Preventing growth or development</td><td>Holding back</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Finite</strong></td><td>Having limits or an end</td><td>Limited</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cultural awareness</strong></td><td>Understanding and appreciation of different cultures</td><td>Knowing about other cultures</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Up-to-date</strong></td><td>Modern; using the latest information or technology</td><td>Current</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Checkbox-style lessons</strong></td><td>Superficial teaching that merely fulfils a requirement</td><td>Lessons done just to tick a box</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Educational outcomes</strong></td><td>The results or achievements of learning</td><td>Learning results</td></tr></tbody></table>",

It is evident that younger individuals spent significantly more time on screens than older age groups.</p>\n<p>The highest screen usage was recorded among those aged 10-19, who spent an average of 7.5 hours daily. This figure gradually declined with age: 20-29-year-olds averaged 6.8 hours, while 30-39-year-olds spent around 5.4 hours. The 40-49 age group logged 4.1 hours, and screen time dropped further to 3.2 hours for those aged 50-59. The lowest figure was among those aged 60 and above, with just 2 hours per day.</p>\n<p>The data indicates a clear inverse relationship between age and screen usage. Younger age groups particularly teenagers and young adults, are the most active digital users, like due to social media, entertainment, and education-related activities. In contrast, older generations tend to have less engagement with digital devices.</p>\n<p>In summary, screen time is strongly age-dependent, with usage decreasing steadily as age increases.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"task2\">Task2<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/en/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-008/#task2\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to heading\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some people believe that the internet has brought people closer together, while others think that it has made people more isolated.\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The internet is often hailed as a tool that connects people across the globe. However, while some argue that it fosters closeness, others believe it has led to greater social isolation. Both perspectives hold merit, but I personally believe the internet has overall brought people closer together.</p>\n<p>Proponents of the internet's social benefits point to the ease of communication. Video calls, messaging apps, and social media allow people to stay connected with family and friends regardless of distance. In addition, online communities can offer support for individuals with shared interests or rare conditions, especially those who might struggle with in-person interactions.</p>\n<p>Conversely, critics argue that digital communication has replaced face-to-face interaction. They claim that excessive use of social media may result in superficial relationships, reduced empathy, and a decline in real-world social skills. Furthermore, people who spend long hours online may neglect relationships in their immediate environment.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, the key lies in how the internet is used. When leveraged wisely, it enhances human connection by bridging geographical gaps and providing new forms of interaction. However, overreliance on online communication at the expense of physical presence can lead to emotional distance.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, while the internet can potentially isolate individuals, its overall effect has been to bring people closer-provided it is used to complement, rather than replace, real-life relationships.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"vocabulary--expressions\">Vocabulary &amp; Expressions<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/en/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-008/#vocabulary--expressions\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to heading\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Term / Expression</th><th>Definition</th><th>Simpler Paraphrase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Inverse relationship</strong></td><td>When one value increases as the other decreases</td><td>One goes up, the other goes down</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Digital users</strong></td><td>People who frequently use digital devices or the internet</td><td>People who use screens or the web</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hailed as</strong></td><td>Praised or described as</td><td>Called or celebrated as</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Superficial relationships</strong></td><td>Connections lacking depth or sincerity</td><td>Shallow friendships</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Leverage</strong></td><td>To use something to maximum advantage</td><td>Make good use of something</td></tr><tr><td><strong>At the expense of</strong></td><td>Causing harm to something in order to benefit another</td><td>While hurting something else</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Emotional distance</strong></td><td>Lack of emotional closeness between people</td><td>Feeling far from someone emotionally</td></tr></tbody></table>",

This figure rose steadily, reaching 18% by 2013 and surpassing 30% by 2017. The increase continued more sharply from 2018 onwards, culminating in 40% usage by 2020. The largest annual growth occurred between 2019 and 2010.</p>\n<p>The graph suggests that public adoption of renewable energy gained momentum, likely due to technological improvements, government incentives, and increased environmental awareness.

While some argue that it matches traditional learning in quality, other remain skeptical. I believe that while online learning offers valuable flexibility, it is not yet a full substitute for classroom-based education.</p>\n<p>One major strength of online education is accessibility. Students from remote or underserved areas can access high-quality resources without the need to travel. In addition, digital platforms often allow learners to progress at their own pace and review material repeatedly, which can enhance understanding.</p>\n<p>However, traditional classrooms offer vital social and interactive components that online platforms often lack. Real-time discussions, immediate feedback from teachers, and group activities foster deeper engagement and critical thinking. Furthermore, hands-on subjects such as science or art often require physical presence and equipment, which are difficult to replicate virtually.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, a blended model that incorporates both formats is the most effective. Online tools cna supplement in-person instruction, offering convenience while maintaining academic rigor and interpersonal interaction.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, although online education has considerable advantages, it cannot entirely replace the rich, dynamic experience of traditional classrooms. A hybrid approach is likely to yield the best educational outcomes.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"vocabulary--expressions\">Vocabulary &amp; Expressions<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/en/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-007/#vocabulary--expressions\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to heading\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Term / Expression</th><th>Definition</th><th>Simpler Paraphrase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Consistent upward trend</strong></td><td>A steady and ongoing increase</td><td>Keeps going up</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Culminating</strong></td><td>Reaching the highest point</td><td>Ending at a peak</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gained momentum</strong></td><td>Increased in speed or importance</td><td>Grew faster</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Blended model</strong></td><td>A mix of online and in-person learning</td><td>Combining both ways</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hands-on subjects</strong></td><td>Courses that involve physical activity or tools</td><td>Practical subjects</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Academic rigor</strong></td><td>High standards and thorough learning</td><td>Serious and deep study</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Substitute</strong></td><td>Something that replaces another</td><td>A replacement</td></tr></tbody></table>",

The data reveals that work-life balance and reduced commuting time were the most cited reasons.</p>\n<p>Work-life balance accounted for 30% of the responses, making it the leading factor. This was followed closely by the desire to avoid commuting, which represented 25%. Increased productivity was the third most common reason, at 20%, while health and safety concerns contributes to 15% of responses. Finally, flexible working hours were cited by 10% of participants.</p>\n<p>The data shows a clear trend toward personal convenience and well-being. The top of three reasons-balance, commute, and productivity-collectively represent 75% of the motivations, indicating a preference for conditions that enhance individual efficiency and lifestyle.

While present-focused individuals argue for making the most of today, others maintain that long-term thinking is vital for success. I believe both perspectives have merit and should be balanced.</p>\n<p>Advocates of living in the present argue that focusing on the now enhances happiness and reduces anxiety. They contend that excessive worry about the future can lead to missed opportunities and mental stress. Mindfulness practices, which encourage awareness of the present moment, have been shown to improve emotional well-being and foster gratitude.</p>\n<p>In contrast, those who support planning ahead believe that setting goals and preparing for possible challenges ensures greater stability. Financial planning, career development, and health maintenance all require foresight. Without long-term thinking, people may struggle tot achieve lasting success or face avoidable setbacks.</p>\n<p>In my view, the most effective approach integrates both attitudes. While it is essential to enjoy and engage with daily life, planning for the future provides direction and security. For example, saving money for retirement does not prevent someone from enjoying today's experiences, but rather ensures peace of mind in the long run.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, while it is beneficial to embrace the present, neglecting future planning can lead to adverse consequences. A balanced mindset that values both present enjoyment and future preparedness is key to a fulfilling life.</p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_B5Wd\" id=\"vocabulary--expressions\">Vocabulary &amp; Expressions<a href=\"https://gracefullight.dev/en/ielts/troubleshooting/ielts-transcription-006/#vocabulary--expressions\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to heading\" title=\"Direct link to heading\">​</a></h2>\n<table><thead><tr><th>Term / Expression</th><th>Definition</th><th>Simpler Paraphrase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Work-life balance</strong></td><td>Maintaining a healthy separation between job and personal time</td><td>Equal time for work and rest</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sustained comfort</strong></td><td>Long-lasting ease or convenience</td><td>Ongoing comfort</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mindfulness</strong></td><td>Awareness of the present moment without judgment</td><td>Being focused on now</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Foresight</strong></td><td>The ability to predict or prepare for future needs</td><td>Planning ahead</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Setbacks</strong></td><td>Difficulties or delays that stop progress</td><td>Problems that slow you down</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Peace of mind</strong></td><td>A feeling of calm and security</td><td>Feeling relaxed and safe</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Balanced mindset</strong></td><td>A way of thinking that includes multiple perspectives</td><td>Thinking in a fair, smart way</td></tr></tbody></table>",
