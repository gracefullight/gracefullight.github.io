<p>The line graph illustrates the proportion of the population using renewable energy over an 11-year period from 2010 to 2020. Overall, there was a consistent upward trend throughout the decade.</p>
<p>In 2010, only 12% of the population used renewable energy sources. This figure rose steadily, reaching 18% by 2013 and surpassing 30% by 2017. The increase continued more sharply from 2018 onwards, culminating in 40% usage by 2020. The largest annual growth occurred between 2019 and 2010.</p>
<p>The graph suggests that public adoption of renewable energy gained momentum, likely due to technological improvements, government incentives, and increased environmental awareness. By the end of the period, more than triple the number of people used clean energy compared to 2010, highlighting a substantial behavioral shift in energy consumption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people believe that online education is as effective as traditional classroom learning.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the rise of digital platforms, online education has gained significant popularity. While some argue that it matches traditional learning in quality, other remain skeptical. I believe that while online learning offers valuable flexibility, it is not yet a full substitute for classroom-based education.</p>
<p>One major strength of online education is accessibility. Students from remote or underserved areas can access high-quality resources without the need to travel. In addition, digital platforms often allow learners to progress at their own pace and review material repeatedly, which can enhance understanding.</p>
<p>However, traditional classrooms offer vital social and interactive components that online platforms often lack. Real-time discussions, immediate feedback from teachers, and group activities foster deeper engagement and critical thinking. Furthermore, hands-on subjects such as science or art often require physical presence and equipment, which are difficult to replicate virtually.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a blended model that incorporates both formats is the most effective. Online tools cna supplement in-person instruction, offering convenience while maintaining academic rigor and interpersonal interaction.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although online education has considerable advantages, it cannot entirely replace the rich, dynamic experience of traditional classrooms. A hybrid approach is likely to yield the best educational outcomes.</p>

<p>The pie chart illustrates the main factors influencing people's decision to work remotely in 2024. The data reveals that work-life balance and reduced commuting time were the most cited reasons.</p>
<p>Work-life balance accounted for 30% of the responses, making it the leading factor. This was followed closely by the desire to avoid commuting, which represented 25%. Increased productivity was the third most common reason, at 20%, while health and safety concerns contributes to 15% of responses. Finally, flexible working hours were cited by 10% of participants.</p>
<p>The data shows a clear trend toward personal convenience and well-being. The top of three reasons-balance, commute, and productivity-collectively represent 75% of the motivations, indicating a preference for conditions that enhance individual efficiency and lifestyle. Health-related concerns, while significant during global health crises, appear less dominant in 2024, suggesting a shift in focus from safety to sustained comfort and autonomy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the chart underscores the growing importance of quality of life and flexibility in shaping modern work preferences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people think it is more important to focus on the present, while others believe planning for the future is essential
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an ongoing debate over whether people should prioritize living in the moment or concentrate on future planning. While present-focused individuals argue for making the most of today, others maintain that long-term thinking is vital for success. I believe both perspectives have merit and should be balanced.</p>
<p>Advocates of living in the present argue that focusing on the now enhances happiness and reduces anxiety. They contend that excessive worry about the future can lead to missed opportunities and mental stress. Mindfulness practices, which encourage awareness of the present moment, have been shown to improve emotional well-being and foster gratitude.</p>
<p>In contrast, those who support planning ahead believe that setting goals and preparing for possible challenges ensures greater stability. Financial planning, career development, and health maintenance all require foresight. Without long-term thinking, people may struggle tot achieve lasting success or face avoidable setbacks.</p>
<p>In my view, the most effective approach integrates both attitudes. While it is essential to enjoy and engage with daily life, planning for the future provides direction and security. For example, saving money for retirement does not prevent someone from enjoying today's experiences, but rather ensures peace of mind in the long run.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while it is beneficial to embrace the present, neglecting future planning can lead to adverse consequences. A balanced mindset that values both present enjoyment and future preparedness is key to a fulfilling life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bar chart above shows the installed renewable energy capacity (in gigawatts) by source in Country Z in 2023.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="task1" src="https://gracefullight.dev/en/assets/images/ielts-transcription-005-87ab15ef0aec5855b8278e782a6b5bff.png" width="1979" height="1180" class="img_yneg"></p>
<p>The bar chart compares the installed renewable energy capacity of five sources in Country Z in 2023. It is evident that hydro power leads significantly, whereas geothermal contributes the least.</p>
<p>Hydro energy accounts for the largest capacity at 80 GW. Wind follows with 60 GW, and solar stands at 45 Gw. Biomass has a modest capacity of 20 GW, while geothermal sits at 10 GW, the smallest share. Overall, hydro capacity is four times that of geothermal and double that of wind, indicating a heavy reliance on water-based power generation.</p>
<p>The disparity among success suggests strategic priorities and resource availability. Country Z's abundant river systems likely facilitate extensive hydro installations. Meanwhile, moderate wind and solar capacities reflect ongoing investments, and lower biomass and geothermal figures may be due to technological or geographical constraints. In summary, although Country Z is diversifying its renewable portfolio, the energy mix remains dominated by hydropower.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people believe that governments should prioritize investing in public parks and green spaces to enhance urban living, while others argue that funds should be allocated to infrastructure such as roads and public transport.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Urban planners often debate the allocation of municipal funds between green spaces and infrastructure development. Advocates of public parks emphasize health and environmental benefits, whereas proponents of roads and transit prioritize economic growth and mobility. I maintain that a balanced approach best serves urban populations.</p>
<p>Supporters of green spaces argue that parks improve air quality, reduce urban heat islands, and provide recreational areas crucial for physical and mental well-being. Studies show access to green spaces correlates with lower stress levels and enhanced community cohesion. Additionally, urban greenery can support biodiversity and stormwater management.</p>
<p>Conversely, those favouring infrastructure investments contend that efficient roads and public transport systems drive economic activity, reduce congestion, and enhance accessibility. Well-maintained transport networks facilitate commerce and connect residential areas with employment hubs. In rapidly growing cities, inadequate infrastructure can stifle productivity and exacerbate social inequalities.</p>
<p>I believe integrating both objectives yields optimal outcomes. Cities should designate sufficient areas for parks while simultaneously upgrading transport corridors. For example, linear greenaways alongside bike lanes and bus rapid transit can merge recreational and mobility functions. Such hybrid developments exemplify how urban design can promote sustainability without sacrificing efficiency.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although public parks and infrastructure serve different needs, their benefits are complementary. Thoughtful urban planning that blends green and built environments will foster healthier, more dynamic</p>

<p>The pie chart illustrates the proportion of university graduates working in various employment sectors in Country X in 2024. Overall, the technology sector attracted the highest number of graduates, while the arts and media field employed the fewest.</p>
<p>Specifically, 28% of graduates were employed in the technology sector, making it the most popular field. Education and healthcare followed with 22% and 20%, respectively. The finance sector employed 18% of graduates, whereas the smallest proportion - 12% - pursued careers in arts and media.</p>
<p>These figures suggest a strong preference among graduates for fields offering stability and growth opportunities. Technology's dominance reflects global demand for digital skills, while healthcare and education remain essential services. The lower percentage in arts and media may be due to fewer job openings or perceived job insecurity.</p>
<p>In summary, most university graduates in Country X are entering high-demand, service-oriented fields, indicating current trends in both education and labour market preferences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people think that the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in workplaces is beneficial, while others believe it may have negative effects on employment and society.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked debates about its impact on employment and society. While some welcome AI for its efficiency and innovation, others express concern over job displacement and ethical implications. I believe that with careful management, AI can offer more advantages than drawbacks.</p>
<p>However, critics highlight the risks of widespread automation. Many fear that AI could replace workers in sectors such as manufacturing, retail, and transportation, leading to increased unemployment and inequality. Ethical concerns also arise, particularly around data privacy and decision-making transparency.</p>
<p>In my view, the solution lies in regulation and adaption. Governments should implement policies that retrain displaced workers and ensure AI technologies are used responsibly. Education systems must evolve to prepare future generations with skills that complement AI, such as critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while AI presents legitimate challenges, its benefits can outweigh the risks if approached thoughtfully. Societies that invest in inclusive, forward-thinking policies will be best positioned to thrive in an AI-integrated future.</p>

<p>The line graph illustrates the worldwide increase in access to clean drinking water between 2010 and 2020. Overall, there was a steady upward trend, with access rising from 82% to 95% over the decade.</p>
<p>In 2010, approximately 82% of the global population had access to clean water. This figure climbed gradually, reaching 85% in 2012 and 89% by 2014. From 2015 onwards, the increase was more moderate but consistent, with rates of 90% in 2015, 92% in 2017 and ultimately 95% in 2020. The most significant annual gain occurred between 2010 and 011, where access rose by 2 percentage points.</p>
<p>The data reflects successful international efforts, such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal to ensure water and sanitation for all. Despite progress, the graph indicates that 5% of the population still lacked access by 2020, underscoring ongoing challenges related to infrastructure and resource allocation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people believe that governments should invest heavily in space exploration, whereas others think those funds are better spent on solving problems on Earth. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The debase over funding space exploration versus addressing terrestrial issues has persisted for decades. Advocates of outer space research argue it drives scientific breakthroughs, while critics assert that immediate needs on Earth warrant priority. I contend that a balanced allocation is crucial.</p>
<p>Proponents of space programmes emphasize technological innovation. Missions to the Moon and Mars foster advancements in robotics, materials science, and telecommunications, with downstream benefits such as improved medical imaging and environmental monitoring. Furthermore, space exploration inspires future generations in STEM fields and enhances global collaboration on ambitious projects.</p>
<p>Conversely, opponents argue that pressing problems-such as poverty, climate change, and healthcare-demand urgent resources. With millions lacking basic necessities, critics contend that government budgets should focus on public welfare rather than uncertain extraterrestrial ventures. They point out that excessive spending on space could exacerbate social inequalities and delay solutions to environmental crises.</p>
<p>In my view, governments should maintain robust support for both domains. A fixed percentage of the budget could be earmarked for space research, ensuring continued innovation, while the remainder addresses critical Earth-bound challenges. Collaborative initiatives, like using satellite technology for disaster relief, demonstrate the synergy between space and terrestrial goals.</p>
<p>In conclusion, space exploration and solving Earth's problems are not mutually exclusive. Through prudent budgeting and interdisciplinary projects, societies can advance scientific frontiers while safeguarding human welfare.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The pie chart above shows the percentage distribution of energy sources in Country X in 2024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="task1" src="https://gracefullight.dev/en/assets/images/ielts-transcription-002-6370d9fa384525e7c5b45f2abe90ad4e.png" width="1979" height="1180" class="img_yneg"></p>
<p>The pie chart illustrates the proportions of different energy sources used in Country X in 2024. It is evident that fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix, although renewable and cleaner alternatives make up a substantial share.</p>
<p>Coal accounts for the largest portion of the energy supply at 34%, followed by natural gas at 25%. Combined, these two fossil fuels represent nearly 60% of total energy consumption. Nuclear power contributes 15%, offering a low-emission but non-renewable option. Hydropower and other renewable sources comprise the remainder, with 10% and 16% respectively.</p>
<p>The data highlights a gradual shift towards sustainable energy. Although coal remains the primary source, renewables slightly exceed nuclear energy in contribution. The presence of hydropower also reflects investment in low-impact infrastructure. However, the high reliance on coal and natural gas suggests the country may face challenges meeting long-term emission targets without significant policy changes.</p>
<p>Overall, while Country X has diversified its energy portfolio, fossil fuels continue to play a central role, indicating both progress and persistent dependence on conventional sources.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many people believe that economic growth should be the top priority for governments, while others argue that protecting the environment is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Economic development and environmental conservation are often perceived as competing priorities for governments. While some advocate for policies that drive economic growth, others argue that environmental protection should come first. I believe a balanced approach is essential.</p>
<p>Supporters of economic growth argue that it is the foundation for national prosperity. Expanding industries create employment opportunities, raise living standards, and generate tax revenue that can be reinvested into social services. For developing countries especially, rapid economic expansion is crucial to reducing poverty and improving infrastructure. Proponents also contend that strong economies are better equipped to invest in environmental technologies over time.</p>
<p>In contrast, environmentalists emphasize the long-term consequences of unchecked growth. Industrial expansion often leads to deforestation, air and water pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. These effects can undermine public health, deplete natural resources, and accelerate climate change. Critics warn that prioritizing economic gains without sustainability measures could lead to irreversible damage.</p>
<p>I believe governments should not view these goals as mutually exclusive. Instead, policies should aim for sustainable development-economic advancement that does not compromise the environment. Investments in green technology, eco-friendly infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks can stimulate the economy while safeguarding natural ecosystems. Countries like Sweden and Costa Rica exemplify how environmental and economic goals can coexist.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while economic growth is vital for national progress, it should not come at the expense of the environment. A sustainable, dual-focus strategy will yield more resilient and equitable outcomes in the long run.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bar chart above shows tertiary education enrollment rates (percentage of the population enrolled) in South Korea, the USA, Germany, and Australia in 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="task1" src="https://gracefullight.dev/en/assets/images/ielts-transcription-001-1f2a3fe8aa094eb3b92a5a10f41d0b80.png" width="1979" height="1180" class="img_yneg"></p>
<p>The bar chart above shows tertiary education enrollment rates in four countries in 2020. It is clear that South Korea has the highest rate, while Germany records the lowest.</p>
<p>Specifically, South Korea leads with approximately 70% of its population enrolled in tertiary education. The USA follows at around 45%, and Australia registers a slightly lower rate of approximately 42%. In contrast, Germany's enrollment stands at about 30%, the lowest among the four nations. These figures demonstrate a significant gap of 40 percentage points between South Korea and Germany.</p>
<p>This disparity may be attributable to differing national policies and cultural emphasis on higher education. South Korea's government has invested heavily in university access and societal norms strongly favour academic achievement, which likely drives its high enrollment. Meanwhile, Germany's dual system of vocational training and apprenticeships provides an alternative pathway, reducing the proportion pursuing university degrees. The intermediate rates in the USA and Australia reflect balanced systems combine academic and vocational opportunities. In summary, while all four are developed countries, their tertiary enrollment rates vary widely due to policy and cultural factors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people argue that online education will eventually replace traditional classroom learning. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Advances in digital technology have fuelled debate over whether online education will supplant traditional classroom learning. While virtual platforms offer flexibility and access, many maintain that face-to-face instruction remains indispensable. In my view, neither mode can fully replace the other; instead, a blended approach is optimal.</p>
<p>Advocates of online education highlight its convenience. Students can access lectures and materials remotely, accommodating diverse schedules and geographical limitations. Moreover, interactive tools such as discussion forums and quizzes enable self-paced learning and instant feedback. This model reduces travel costs and allows institutions to reach a broader audience, particularly in underserved regions.</p>
<p>Conversely, proponents of conventional classrooms argue that in-person interaction fosters deeper engagement. Live discussions, hands-on activities and immediate teacher support enhance comprehension and motivation. Classroom environments also build social skills and peer collaboration, which are harder to replicate online. Additionally, maintaining discipline and focus can be more challenging when learners study independently.</p>
<p>However, insisting on a single approach overlooks their complementary strengths. A blended model combining online lectures with periodic in-person seminars can leverage digital convenience while preserving interactive benefits. For instance, foundational concepts might be taught online, freeing classroom time for discussion and practical application. Such integration not only caters to varied learning styles but also prepares students for a digitally connected world.</p>
<p>In conclusion, online education and traditional classrooms each offer unique advantages that the other lacks. Rather than viewing one as the inevitable successor, educational stakeholders should embrace a hybrid system to maximize learning outcomes.</p>
