<p>The pie charts illustrate the distribution of household expenditure across four categories-housing, food, transport, and other-in a country in 2015 and 2020. Overall, there was a noticeable shift in spending patterns, with food and transport increasing in proportion while housing and other expenses declined.</p>
<p>In 2015, housing accounted for the largest share at 35% followed by food at 25%, and both transport and other categories at 20% each. By 2020, food expenditure rose to 30%, equalling housing, which decreased to 30%. Transport expenditure increased to 25%, while the "other" category saw a reduction to 15%.</p>
<p>The most significant change was the 5-percentage-point increase in food expenditure, reflecting its growing importance in household budgets. Transport also gained prominence, rising by 5 percentage points, whereas housing lost its dominant position. The decline in the "other" category suggests a reallocation of funds toward essential expenses, likely driven by economic or lifestyle changes over the five-year period.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people believe that governments should invest heavily in public transportation to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. Others argue that improving road infrastructure is a more effective solution.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The debate over whether governments should prioritize public transportation or road infrastructure to address traffic congestion and pollution is multifaceted. Both approaches have merit, but their effectiveness depends on context. This essay will discuss both perspectives and present my own view.</p>
<p>Advocates of public transportation argue that it offers a sustainable solution to urban challenges. Efficient systems like buses, trains, and subways can transport large numbers of people, reducing the number of private vehicles on roads. For instance, cities like Tokyo have invested in extensive metro systems, significantly lowering per-capita emissions and easing traffic flow. Public transport is also more accessible to lower-income groups, promoting social equity. Furthermore, modern electric buses and trains can substantially reduce pollution, aligning with environmental goals.</p>
<p>Conversely, proponents of road infrastructure improvements argue that better roads enhance traffic efficiency. Widening highways, building flyovers, or implementing smart traffic systems can alleviate bottlenecks, as seen in cities like Dubai, where advanced road networks reduce travel times. Critics of public transport investments note that such projects are costly and time-consuming, and may not address immediate congestion issues in rapidly growing urban areas.</p>
<p>In my opinion, investing in public transportation is more effective in the long term. It addresses both congestion and pollution while promoting sustainable urban development. However, strategic road improvements can complement these efforts, particularly in areas with limited public transport infrastructure. A balanced approach, prioritizing public transport with targeted road enhancements, offers the most holistic solution to urban mobility challenges.</p>]]></content>

<blockquote>
<p>The table below shows the percentage of households with internet access in four regions for the years 2010, 2015 and 2020, and the overall change between 2010 and 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<table><thead><tr><th>Region</th><th>2010 (%)</th><th>2015 (%)</th><th>2020 (%)</th><th>Change (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>North America</td><td>65</td><td>80</td><td>92</td><td>+27</td></tr><tr><td>Europe</td><td>58</td><td>75</td><td>89</td><td>+31</td></tr><tr><td>Asia</td><td>42</td><td>60</td><td>75</td><td>+33</td></tr><tr><td>Sub-Saharan Africa</td><td>15</td><td>30</td><td>48</td><td>+33</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The table compares household internet access rates in four regions-North America, Europe, Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa across 2010, 2015 and 2020, and shows the percentage-point change over the decade. Overall, all regions experienced substantial increases, with Asis and Sub-Saharan Africa recording the largest gains.</p>
<p>In 2010, North America led with 65% access, rising to 92% by 2020, a change of +27 points. Europe followed, increasing from 58% to 89% (+31). Asia saw access climb from 42% to 75% (+33), matching Sub-Saharan Africa's growth, which rose from a low base of 15% to 48% (+33). By 2020, the gap between the highest and lowest regions had narrowed from 50 points in 2010 to 44 points.</p>
<p>The data indicates that developing regions made the most rapid progress, likely due to infrastructure investments and policy initiatives promoting connectivity. In contrast, advanced regions like North America and Europe showed more modest absolute increases, as they began from higher starting points. In summary, while all regions improved, the greatest relative expansion occurred where initial access was lowest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people believe that learning computer programming should be a compulsory part of the school curriculum.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While computer programming offers clear benefits, I disagree that it should be compulsory for all school students. Mandating coding risks overloading curricula, may not suit every leaner, and could divert attention from equally vital subjects.</p>
<p>Firstly, a one-size-fits-all approach can overwhelm students whose strengths lie elsewhere. Not every child has an aptitude for abstract, logical thinking required in programming. Forcing all pupils to learn to code may discourage those who would excel in areas such as the arts, humanities or languages, thereby stifling diverse talents.</p>
<p>Secondly, curriculum time is finite. Introducing compulsory coding would necessitate reducing hours for other core subjects-such as literature, history or the natural sciences-which cultivate critical cultural awareness and scientific literacy. These disciplines are essential for fostering well-rounded individuals and informed citizens.</p>
<p>Finally, effective programming instruction requires skilled teachers and up-to-date resources. Many schools, particularly in under-resourced areas, lack qualified computer science educators and sufficient technological infrastructure. Compulsory coding risks creating superficial, checkbox-style lessons that fail to develop genuine proficiency.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although programming is a valuable skill in our digital age, it should remain an optional subject. Allowing students to choose based on their interests and strengths preserves curriculum balance and respects individual aptitudes, leading to better educational outcomes overall.</p>

<p>The bar chart presents data on the average daily screen time across six age groups in 2024. It is evident that younger individuals spent significantly more time on screens than older age groups.</p>
<p>The highest screen usage was recorded among those aged 10-19, who spent an average of 7.5 hours daily. This figure gradually declined with age: 20-29-year-olds averaged 6.8 hours, while 30-39-year-olds spent around 5.4 hours. The 40-49 age group logged 4.1 hours, and screen time dropped further to 3.2 hours for those aged 50-59. The lowest figure was among those aged 60 and above, with just 2 hours per day.</p>
<p>The data indicates a clear inverse relationship between age and screen usage. Younger age groups particularly teenagers and young adults, are the most active digital users, like due to social media, entertainment, and education-related activities. In contrast, older generations tend to have less engagement with digital devices.</p>
<p>In summary, screen time is strongly age-dependent, with usage decreasing steadily as age increases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people believe that the internet has brought people closer together, while others think that it has made people more isolated.

</blockquote>
<p>The internet is often hailed as a tool that connects people across the globe. However, while some argue that it fosters closeness, others believe it has led to greater social isolation. Both perspectives hold merit, but I personally believe the internet has overall brought people closer together.</p>
<p>Proponents of the internet's social benefits point to the ease of communication. Video calls, messaging apps, and social media allow people to stay connected with family and friends regardless of distance. In addition, online communities can offer support for individuals with shared interests or rare conditions, especially those who might struggle with in-person interactions.</p>
<p>Conversely, critics argue that digital communication has replaced face-to-face interaction. They claim that excessive use of social media may result in superficial relationships, reduced empathy, and a decline in real-world social skills. Furthermore, people who spend long hours online may neglect relationships in their immediate environment.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the key lies in how the internet is used. When leveraged wisely, it enhances human connection by bridging geographical gaps and providing new forms of interaction. However, overreliance on online communication at the expense of physical presence can lead to emotional distance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the internet can potentially isolate individuals, its overall effect has been to bring people closer-provided it is used to complement, rather than replace, real-life relationships.</p>

<p>The line graph illustrates the proportion of the population using renewable energy over an 11-year period from 2010 to 2020. Overall, there was a consistent upward trend throughout the decade.</p>
<p>In 2010, only 12% of the population used renewable energy sources. This figure rose steadily, reaching 18% by 2013 and surpassing 30% by 2017. The increase continued more sharply from 2018 onwards, culminating in 40% usage by 2020. The largest annual growth occurred between 2019 and 2010.</p>
<p>The graph suggests that public adoption of renewable energy gained momentum, likely due to technological improvements, government incentives, and increased environmental awareness. By the end of the period, more than triple the number of people used clean energy compared to 2010, highlighting a substantial behavioral shift in energy consumption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people believe that online education is as effective as traditional classroom learning.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the rise of digital platforms, online education has gained significant popularity. While some argue that it matches traditional learning in quality, other remain skeptical. I believe that while online learning offers valuable flexibility, it is not yet a full substitute for classroom-based education.</p>
<p>One major strength of online education is accessibility. Students from remote or underserved areas can access high-quality resources without the need to travel. In addition, digital platforms often allow learners to progress at their own pace and review material repeatedly, which can enhance understanding.</p>
<p>However, traditional classrooms offer vital social and interactive components that online platforms often lack. Real-time discussions, immediate feedback from teachers, and group activities foster deeper engagement and critical thinking. Furthermore, hands-on subjects such as science or art often require physical presence and equipment, which are difficult to replicate virtually.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a blended model that incorporates both formats is the most effective. Online tools cna supplement in-person instruction, offering convenience while maintaining academic rigor and interpersonal interaction.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although online education has considerable advantages, it cannot entirely replace the rich, dynamic experience of traditional classrooms. A hybrid approach is likely to yield the best educational outcomes.</p>

<p>The pie chart illustrates the main factors influencing people's decision to work remotely in 2024. The data reveals that work-life balance and reduced commuting time were the most cited reasons.</p>
<p>Work-life balance accounted for 30% of the responses, making it the leading factor. This was followed closely by the desire to avoid commuting, which represented 25%. Increased productivity was the third most common reason, at 20%, while health and safety concerns contributes to 15% of responses. Finally, flexible working hours were cited by 10% of participants.</p>
<p>The data shows a clear trend toward personal convenience and well-being. The top of three reasons-balance, commute, and productivity-collectively represent 75% of the motivations, indicating a preference for conditions that enhance individual efficiency and lifestyle. Health-related concerns, while significant during global health crises, appear less dominant in 2024, suggesting a shift in focus from safety to sustained comfort and autonomy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the chart underscores the growing importance of quality of life and flexibility in shaping modern work preferences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people think it is more important to focus on the present, while others believe planning for the future is essential
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an ongoing debate over whether people should prioritize living in the moment or concentrate on future planning. While present-focused individuals argue for making the most of today, others maintain that long-term thinking is vital for success. I believe both perspectives have merit and should be balanced.</p>
<p>Advocates of living in the present argue that focusing on the now enhances happiness and reduces anxiety. They contend that excessive worry about the future can lead to missed opportunities and mental stress. Mindfulness practices, which encourage awareness of the present moment, have been shown to improve emotional well-being and foster gratitude.</p>
<p>In contrast, those who support planning ahead believe that setting goals and preparing for possible challenges ensures greater stability. Financial planning, career development, and health maintenance all require foresight. Without long-term thinking, people may struggle tot achieve lasting success or face avoidable setbacks.</p>
<p>In my view, the most effective approach integrates both attitudes. While it is essential to enjoy and engage with daily life, planning for the future provides direction and security. For example, saving money for retirement does not prevent someone from enjoying today's experiences, but rather ensures peace of mind in the long run.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while it is beneficial to embrace the present, neglecting future planning can lead to adverse consequences. A balanced mindset that values both present enjoyment and future preparedness is key to a fulfilling life.</p>

<p>The bar chart compares the installed renewable energy capacity of five sources in Country Z in 2023. It is evident that hydro power leads significantly, whereas geothermal contributes the least.</p>
<p>Hydro energy accounts for the largest capacity at 80 GW. Wind follows with 60 GW, and solar stands at 45 Gw. Biomass has a modest capacity of 20 GW, while geothermal sits at 10 GW, the smallest share. Overall, hydro capacity is four times that of geothermal and double that of wind, indicating a heavy reliance on water-based power generation.</p>
<p>The disparity among success suggests strategic priorities and resource availability. Country Z's abundant river systems likely facilitate extensive hydro installations. Meanwhile, moderate wind and solar capacities reflect ongoing investments, and lower biomass and geothermal figures may be due to technological or geographical constraints. In summary, although Country Z is diversifying its renewable portfolio, the energy mix remains dominated by hydropower.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people believe that governments should prioritize investing in public parks and green spaces to enhance urban living, while others argue that funds should be allocated to infrastructure such as roads and public transport.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Urban planners often debate the allocation of municipal funds between green spaces and infrastructure development. Advocates of public parks emphasize health and environmental benefits, whereas proponents of roads and transit prioritize economic growth and mobility. I maintain that a balanced approach best serves urban populations.</p>
<p>Supporters of green spaces argue that parks improve air quality, reduce urban heat islands, and provide recreational areas crucial for physical and mental well-being. Studies show access to green spaces correlates with lower stress levels and enhanced community cohesion. Additionally, urban greenery can support biodiversity and stormwater management.</p>
<p>Conversely, those favouring infrastructure investments contend that efficient roads and public transport systems drive economic activity, reduce congestion, and enhance accessibility. Well-maintained transport networks facilitate commerce and connect residential areas with employment hubs. In rapidly growing cities, inadequate infrastructure can stifle productivity and exacerbate social inequalities.</p>
<p>I believe integrating both objectives yields optimal outcomes. Cities should designate sufficient areas for parks while simultaneously upgrading transport corridors. For example, linear greenaways alongside bike lanes and bus rapid transit can merge recreational and mobility functions. Such hybrid developments exemplify how urban design can promote sustainability without sacrificing efficiency.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although public parks and infrastructure serve different needs, their benefits are complementary. Thoughtful urban planning that blends green and built environments will foster healthier, more dynamic</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people think that the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in workplaces is beneficial, while others believe it may have negative effects on employment and society.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked debates about its impact on employment and society. While some welcome AI for its efficiency and innovation, others express concern over job displacement and ethical implications. I believe that with careful management, AI can offer more advantages than drawbacks.</p>
<p>However, critics highlight the risks of widespread automation. Many fear that AI could replace workers in sectors such as manufacturing, retail, and transportation, leading to increased unemployment and inequality. Ethical concerns also arise, particularly around data privacy and decision-making transparency.</p>
<p>In my view, the solution lies in regulation and adaption. Governments should implement policies that retrain displaced workers and ensure AI technologies are used responsibly. Education systems must evolve to prepare future generations with skills that complement AI, such as critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while AI presents legitimate challenges, its benefits can outweigh the risks if approached thoughtfully. Societies that invest in inclusive, forward-thinking policies will be best positioned to thrive in an AI-integrated future.</p>

<p>The line graph illustrates the worldwide increase in access to clean drinking water between 2010 and 2020. Overall, there was a steady upward trend, with access rising from 82% to 95% over the decade.</p>
<p>In 2010, approximately 82% of the global population had access to clean water. This figure climbed gradually, reaching 85% in 2012 and 89% by 2014. From 2015 onwards, the increase was more moderate but consistent, with rates of 90% in 2015, 92% in 2017 and ultimately 95% in 2020. The most significant annual gain occurred between 2010 and 011, where access rose by 2 percentage points.</p>
<p>The data reflects successful international efforts, such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal to ensure water and sanitation for all. Despite progress, the graph indicates that 5% of the population still lacked access by 2020, underscoring ongoing challenges related to infrastructure and resource allocation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some people believe that governments should invest heavily in space exploration, whereas others think those funds are better spent on solving problems on Earth. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The debase over funding space exploration versus addressing terrestrial issues has persisted for decades. Advocates of outer space research argue it drives scientific breakthroughs, while critics assert that immediate needs on Earth warrant priority. I contend that a balanced allocation is crucial.</p>
<p>Proponents of space programmes emphasize technological innovation. Missions to the Moon and Mars foster advancements in robotics, materials science, and telecommunications, with downstream benefits such as improved medical imaging and environmental monitoring. Furthermore, space exploration inspires future generations in STEM fields and enhances global collaboration on ambitious projects.</p>
<p>Conversely, opponents argue that pressing problems-such as poverty, climate change, and healthcare-demand urgent resources. With millions lacking basic necessities, critics contend that government budgets should focus on public welfare rather than uncertain extraterrestrial ventures. They point out that excessive spending on space could exacerbate social inequalities and delay solutions to environmental crises.</p>
<p>In my view, governments should maintain robust support for both domains. A fixed percentage of the budget could be earmarked for space research, ensuring continued innovation, while the remainder addresses critical Earth-bound challenges. Collaborative initiatives, like using satellite technology for disaster relief, demonstrate the synergy between space and terrestrial goals.</p>
<p>In conclusion, space exploration and solving Earth's problems are not mutually exclusive. Through prudent budgeting and interdisciplinary projects, societies can advance scientific frontiers while safeguarding human welfare.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many people believe that economic growth should be the top priority for governments, while others argue that protecting the environment is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Economic development and environmental conservation are often perceived as competing priorities for governments. While some advocate for policies that drive economic growth, others argue that environmental protection should come first. I believe a balanced approach is essential.</p>
<p>Supporters of economic growth argue that it is the foundation for national prosperity. Expanding industries create employment opportunities, raise living standards, and generate tax revenue that can be reinvested into social services. For developing countries especially, rapid economic expansion is crucial to reducing poverty and improving infrastructure. Proponents also contend that strong economies are better equipped to invest in environmental technologies over time.</p>
<p>In contrast, environmentalists emphasize the long-term consequences of unchecked growth. Industrial expansion often leads to deforestation, air and water pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. These effects can undermine public health, deplete natural resources, and accelerate climate change. Critics warn that prioritizing economic gains without sustainability measures could lead to irreversible damage.</p>
<p>I believe governments should not view these goals as mutually exclusive. Instead, policies should aim for sustainable development-economic advancement that does not compromise the environment. Investments in green technology, eco-friendly infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks can stimulate the economy while safeguarding natural ecosystems. Countries like Sweden and Costa Rica exemplify how environmental and economic goals can coexist.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while economic growth is vital for national progress, it should not come at the expense of the environment. A sustainable, dual-focus strategy will yield more resilient and equitable outcomes in the long run.</p>
